title: "Image Registry"
---

A Docker image is a read-only template that can be used to deploy container services, each with a specific unique identifier (i.e. Image name:Tag). For example, an image can contain a full Ubuntu operating system environment with only Apache or other applications that users need. The image registry is used to store and distribute Docker images.

## Prerequisites

You need to create a workspace and project, see the [Admin Quick Start](../admin-quick-start) if not yet.

## Create a ConfigMap

Sign in with project-regular, enter into one project (e.g. demo-namespace), then select **Configuration Center â†’ Secrets**.
