User rights management relies on role definitions, which identify the user's identity and define the relationship between the user and the resources that are accessible/operable. When the KubeSphere Pre-configuration role does not meet the usage requirements, you can create a custom role for the user based on the actual situation. The biggest advantage of the custom role is the fine-grained management of the platform resources. Specify which of the specified resources the role has. Permissions.

## Creating a Role  

Log in to the KubeSphere Management Console, go to the created project, go to the left menu bar and select **Project Settings â†’ Member Roles**. As a project administrator, you can view all the role information under the current project.
